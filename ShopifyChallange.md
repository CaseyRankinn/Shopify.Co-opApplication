# Winter 2022 Data Science Intern Challenge 
## Question 1: Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: 

On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe.
We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13.
Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

### a) Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.
      
- How I approached this problem was simple. I thought to myself, what makes this data "incorrect"? When I quickly skimmed 
through the dataset there were few large numbers that were most like the result of the average calculation outcome as $3145.13. I rearranged the numbers in the column
from smallest value to largest value and I saw that the numbers 704000, 154350, 102900, 77175, 51450, 25725 didn't match with the average data with the overall 
data set of order_amount, as there was a big jump from 1760 to 25725. These numbers are the ouliers and are effecting the accuracy of the data. 

- Therefore, the issue with this calculation is that there are a few values under the order_amounts column that jump a large amount comparative to the rest of the dataset.
A better method to calculate this data would be to remove these outliers and then calculate the average (mean).
- Another method to solving this problem: If one did not want to remove any data from the data set, it would be appropriate in this case to find the median instead. 
Since the dataset is large and a majority of the values fall withing a range, finding the median would be more accurate than the mean. 
  

### b) What metric would you report for this dataset?

- The metric I would use for this dataset is to find the median value instead of the mean because you are still able to keep all of the data in the problem and still have 
an accurate evaluation. This is a great example of the importance of data analysis because we are able to interperate the data and improve the efficiency of the dataset.  




### c) What is its value?
- By removing the outliers (704000, 154350, 102900, 77175, 51450, 25725) from the data set, the average(median) would be : $302.58
- By not changing the data and calculating the median, the average would be: $284.00

## Question 2: For this question youâ€™ll need to use SQL. 
Follow this link to access the data set required for the challenge. 
Please use queries to answer the following questions. 
Paste your queries along with your final numerical answers below.

### a) How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total?

In this questions I look at the keywords: **Orders**, **Speedy Express** + we are looking for a Quantity (therefore, a number)
Therefore I will look individually where these values are located. 
- The Shippers Table holds the ShipperName **Speedy Express**
- Orders holds the ShipperID that is associated with every **Order**, where we can calucate the amount of Shipper Id's associated with 
Speedy Express using a JOIN because they have the common value of **ShipperID**. 

1) We want the COUNT of ShipperID's column to be our final query result. : **SELECT COUNT (Shippers.ShipperID)**
2) We want to specify the Shippers table to be used in the final query result : **FROM Shippers**
3) To concatenate the data from Orders and Shippers we must use a JOIN Clause. : **JOIN Orders ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID**
4) We must filter our data, as we only want to see the orders where the ShipperName is equal to "Speedy Express" : **WHERE Shippers.ShipperName = "Speedy Express";**

```
    SELECT COUNT (Shippers.ShipperID)
    FROM Shippers
    JOIN Orders ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
    WHERE Shippers.ShipperName = "Speedy Express";
```
**Result** = 54
    
### b) What is the last name of the employee with the most orders?

In this question I look at the keywords: **Last Name**, **Employee**, **Orders**.
- Employees Table holds the **LastName** Column.
- Orders table holds the Quantity of **Orders** related to the EmployeeID which is a common value in the Employees Table. 

1) We want the final query to show us a result under the LastName column. : **SELECT Employees.LastName**
2) We want to Specify the Employees table to be used in the final query result: **FROM Employees**
3) We need to concatenate the data from the Orders table and the Employees Table with the common values of EmployeeID so that we can count how many orders are associate 
with a corresponding employeeId. : **JOIN Orders ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID**
4) We must group together rows that have common values of EmployeeId so that we don't get multiple values of EmployeeId.: **GROUP BY Employees.EmployeeID**
5) We use the ORDER BY , COUNT and DESC clause to order by the amount a EmployeeID occures. This will give us the number of orders that an Employee's Id has made (ie. most orders to least orders). : **ORDER BY COUNT (Employees.EmployeeID) DESC**
6) Finally, to get a final answer we just want to Top of the list which will be the most occuring EmployeeId's Last Name to appear : **LIMIT 1;**  

```
    SELECT Employees.LastName
    FROM Employees 
    JOIN Orders ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
    GROUP BY Employees.EmployeeID
    ORDER BY COUNT (Employees.EmployeeID) DESC
    LIMIT 1; 
 ```
**Result** = Peacock  

  
### c) What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?

In this question I look at the key words : Product, Ordered, Customers, Germany. 
Therefore I look individually where these values are located. 
- There is a Product table that holds Product Names which will tell me which **Product** is ordered by name, but I still need more data.
- There is a Customer table that tells me the info of the purchasers, here I am able to see the countries, where I can get **Germany** data from.
- Now I need to find a link to these tables so that I can find how many and which products were ordered from germany. 
- OrderDetails table has the **Quantity** column I am looking for. Now that I know where the data I am looking for is, I start typing my Query. 
- I need to Write a Query that will allow all this data to connect and filter through the data. 

1) We want the ProductName columns to be listed in the final query results : **SELECT Products.ProductName**
2) We want to specify the Products table to be used in the final query result :  **FROM Products** 
3) I am using JOIN clauses because I want to obtain data from a number of tables. To get the answer we want, we have to compare data from multiple tables.    
   - First, we want to concatenate the rows of OrderDetails Table with Products in order to get a list of all the Products that match the 
   OrderDetails, by ProductId. : **JOIN OrderDetails ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductId**  
   - Now we want to concatenate the Orders Table with the OrderDetails Table, with their common values of OrderId to be able to connect the Products table, 
   Customer table and OrderDetails Table. : **JOIN Orders ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderId**
   - Lastly, concatenate the Customers Table with Orders with the common values of Customer Id : **JOIN Customers ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerId**
4) Now, we want to filter through our tables data to display the correct query result we are looking for. 
   - We want to specify the rows in Table Customer, Row Country that matches "Germany" to be listed. :  **WHERE Customers.Country = "Germany"**
   - We want to group together rows that have common values of ProductName so that I don't get multiple values of ProductName. : **GROUP BY Products.ProductName** 
   - Now I want to put the data in Order by sum of the Quantity of orders so that I know which ProductName was ordered the most in descending order. : **ORDER BY SUM(OrderDetails.Quantity) DESC** 
   - Finally, to clean it all up, we want a clear answer and just display the top result. : **LIMIT 1;**
  
  ```
      SELECT Products.ProductName 
      FROM Products  
      JOIN OrderDetails ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductId 
      JOIN Orders ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderId 
      JOIN Customers ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerId 
      WHERE Customers.Country = "Germany" 
      GROUP BY Products.ProductName  
      ORDER BY SUM(OrderDetails.Quantity) DESC 
      LIMIT 1;
   ```
**Result** = Boston Crab Meat
